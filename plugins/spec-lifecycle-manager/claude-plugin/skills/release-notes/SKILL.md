# Release Notes

## Overview

Use this skill to turn local Git history into reviewed release notes for Spec
Lifecycle Manager. The `slc release notes` command gathers evidence; an
LLM-backed agent must refine that evidence into the repository release-note
format.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target release version and previous stable release tag.
   Prefer `package.json#/version` for the target version unless the user gives a
   version explicitly. Prefer the previous reachable stable `vX.Y.Z` tag for
   `--from`.

2. Generate evidence and a draft:

```bash
slc release notes \
  --from vPREVIOUS \
  --to HEAD \
  --version X.Y.Z \
  --output docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z-draft.md \
  --evidence-output docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z-evidence.json \
  --agent-instructions docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z-agent.md
```

3. Read the generated agent instructions and JSON evidence before editing final
   notes. Treat the evidence as source material, not final prose.

4. Write the reviewed note to `docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`. Do not keep the
   draft, evidence, or agent instruction files unless the user explicitly asks
   to preserve them.

5. Run relevant validation after editing release notes. At minimum, check
   `git diff --check`; for release process changes also run
   `npm run test:devcli` and `npm run validate`.

## Release Note Format

Use this structure unless the existing release-note file for the version already
establishes a better one:

```markdown
---
title: Spec Lifecycle Manager vX.Y.Z release notes
doc_type: release-notes
status: published
owner: platform
last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Spec Lifecycle Manager vX.Y.Z

## Highlights

- Summarize the release by user-visible outcomes.

## Added

- List new capabilities, commands, workflows, packaged surfaces, or prompts.

## Changed

- List behavioral, process, packaging, or documentation changes.

## Fixed

- List bug fixes and corrected contracts.

## Documentation

- List durable documentation and lifecycle updates.

## Validation

- List validation that actually ran or durable validation coverage added.

## Known Issues

- List remaining limitations, uncertainty, or follow-up work.
```

## Writing Rules

- Group by consumer impact rather than by commit.
- Do not paste the git log or summarize every commit line.
- Do not claim validation unless it appears in evidence or was run in the
  current session.
- Keep low-confidence items in `Known Issues` or omit them rather than guessing.
- Mention skill, MCP, prompt, packaging, CLI, compatibility, and validation
  impacts when the evidence supports them.
- Preserve concrete command and path names where they help users act.
